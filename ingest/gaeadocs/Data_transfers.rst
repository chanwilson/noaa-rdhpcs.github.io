Introduction
============

Available on Gaea is a tool called GCP, which allows for internal
transfers on Gaea and to/from other NOAA RDHPCS resources (ZEUS and GFDL
PPAN). Please reference `System Details <System_details>`__ if you are
unfamiliar with the filesystems or expected use of each variety of node
on Gaea.

.. _available_tools:

Available Tools
===============

-  `GCP <Gcp>`__
-  spdcp - lustre to lustre specific
-  globus-url-copy (`GridFTP <Gridftp>`__)
-  scp
-  rsync
-  cp
-  hsi and htar (for Zeus' HPSS)

We suggest all users use `GCP <Gcp>`__ as the primary data transfer
tool.

Examples
========

.. _f2___f2:

f2 <-> f2
---------

Users can transfer data between the lustre f2 filesystem using GCP. This
can be done on the login nodes, and ldtns Gco commands issued on the
compute nodes will result in a [L|R]DTN job being created and gcp will
block until that job is completed by defaut.

::

   module load gcp
   gcp /lustre/f2/dev/$USER/file /lustre/f2/scratch/$USER/path/file

.. _gaea___gfdl:

Gaea <-> GFDL
-------------

Users can transfer data between GFDL and Gaea filesystems with
`GCP <Gcp>`__. This can be done on the login nodes and rdtn's only.
Users can interactively run gcp commands from a login node or submit gcp
calls in scripts to run in the rdtn queue.

::

   module load gcp
   gcp gaea:/lustre/f2/scratch/$USER/file gfdl:/gfdl/specific/path/file
   gcp gfdl:/gfdl/specific/path/file gaea:/lustre/f2/dev/$USER/path/file

.. _gaea___remote_noaa_site:

Gaea <-> Remote NOAA Site
-------------------------

Users can transfer data between GFDL and Gaea filesystems with
`GridFTP <Gridftp>`__, rsync or scp. This can be done on the login nodes
and RDTNs only. Please place large transfers (>1GB) in batch jobs on the
RDTN queue. This will respect other users on the login nodes by reducing
interactive impact.

::

   scp /lustre/f2/scratch/$USER/path/name/here some.remote.site:/a/path/over/there
   globus-url-copy file:/path/on/Gaea/file gsiftp://some.remote.site/path/to/destination/file
   globus-url-copy gsiftp://some.remote.site/path/to/remote/file file:/destination/path/on/Gaea/file

.. _gaea___external:

Gaea <-> External
-----------------

Users can use port tunnels associated with their login sessions to move
files between Gaea and their workstations. NOAA users will find this to
be far slower than GCP.

-  Get your uid from the 'id' command on Gaea. Substitute your Gaea user
   name for First.Last
-  Log out of Gaea entirely.
-  Edit your workstation's ~/.ssh/config file to contain the following
   (you can also put this on your desktop/laptop workstation):

::

   Host gaea
     HostName                gaea.rdhpcs.noaa.gov
     User                    First.Last
     ControlMaster           auto
     LocalForward            uid+30000 localhost:uid+30000
     RemoteForward           uid+20000 localhost:22
     NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes

   Host gaea1 gaea2 gaea3 gaea4 gaea5 gaea6 gaea7 gaea8 gaea?.ncrc.gov
     HostName                localhost
     Port                    uid+30000
     User                    First.Last
     LogLevel                Quiet

   Host *
     CheckHostIP yes
     ForwardAgent            yes
     ForwardX11Trusted       yes
     ControlPath ~/.ssh/%r@%h:%p
     ControlMaster           no
     AddressFamily       inet
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ntt_id_rsa
     ServerAliveInterval     60

-  Run: ssh gaea
-  Check that your tunnels get created (there will be a bit of output
   near the banner about this.)
-  In your Gaea session, cd to the location you want your file to be
   transferred to.
-  In your Gaea session, run scp -P 50017
   your_workstation_username@localhost:/path/to/file .

.. _gaea___fairmont_hpss:

Gaea <-> Fairmont HPSS
----------------------

Users can transfer data between Gaea and Zeus' High Performance Storage
System (HPSS) through the use of the HSI and HTAR commands. These
commands are only available on Gaea's Remote Data Transfer Nodes
(RDTNs). A user can submit a script to run on the RDTNs.

-  Minimum Headers for a submitted RDTN job.

::

   #SBATCH --clusters=es
   #SBATCH --partition=rdtn

-  Load the HSI module and list the contents of your directory

::

   module use -a /sw/rdtn/modulefiles
   module load hsi

-  Check connectivity to the hsi, replacing the below file path with
   yours on HPSS

::

   hsi &quot;ls -P /BMC/nesccmgmt/$USER/&quot;

-  Retrieve Files using HSI into the current directory on the RDTN. The
   -q option limits output spam.

::

   hsi -q &quot;get /BMC/nesccmgmt/Karol.Zieba/sample_file&quot;

-  Upload Files using HSI

::

   hsi -q &quot;put /lustre/f2/scratch/$USER/file_to_upload : /BMC/nesccmgmt/$USER/file_to_upload&quot;

-  Tar many small files from the RDTN using HTAR. Note that using
   asterisk will not work.

::

   htar cf /BMC/nesccmgmt/$USER/tarred_file.tar file1 file2 path/file3

-  Untar many small files into your current directory on the RDTN using
   HTAR

::

   htar xf /BMC/nesccmgmt/$USER/tarred_file.tar

Further information on interfacing with HPSS and the HSI/HTAR commands
can be found below.

.. _external_untrusted_data_transfers:

External (Untrusted) Data Transfers
-----------------------------------

To support external data transfers with methods that are faster and
simpler than the port tunnel method, NOAA RDHPCS has a data transfer
node. This means data can be transferred to Gaea without the use of the
port tunnel or existing ssh connection. Not only is this simpler, but
provides for much faster transfers. The difference between the eDTN and
the DTN as described above is that the eDTN does not mount the Gaea
filesystems. Transferring through the eDTN to Gaea requires a two step
process. First, files are transferred from external hosts to the eDTN.
Second, from Gaea, the files are pulled back from the eDTN.

For authentication, use of your token is required from external
transfers to the eDTN. From within Gaea, use of your token is not
required.

The eDTN supports the use of scp, sftp, bbcp, and ssh based
globus-url-copy.

Copying files from external systems to the eDTN

::

   jsmith# scp WRF.tar.gz John.Smith@edtn.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov:
    Access is via First.Last username only.  Enter RSA PASSCODE:

The trailing colon (':') is critical. You can also specify
":/home/John.Smith/"

Your response should be your pin+PASSCODE.

.. _retrieving_files_on_gaea_from_the_edtn:

Retrieving files on Gaea from the eDTN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To transfer files from the eDTN server to Gaea without requiring your
token, you must use GSI enabled transfer methods. For scp, sftp, and
bbcp, this mean appending "gsi" to the front of the command. So the
commands that are best to use are gsiscp, gsisftp, and gsibbcp.

To pull the files back from the eDTN, initiate on of these commands:

::

   John.Smith# gsiscp -S `which gsissh` edtn.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov:WRF.tar.gz .

.. _edtn_purge_policy:

eDTN Purge Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Files older than 7 days will be automatically removed. This policy may
change based on disk space and management needs.

.. _managing_files_on_the_edtn:

Managing files on the eDTN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to login and manage any files, create or remove directories,
or any other tasks on the eDTN, use gsisftp from Gaea. This provides and
FTP like interface through ssh.

::

   # sftp -S `which gsissh` John.Smith@edtn.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov
   Access is via First.Last username only. Enter RSA PASSCODE:
   Connected to edtn.fairmont.rdhpcs.noaa.gov.
