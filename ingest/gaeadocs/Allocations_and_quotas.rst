CPU allocations on Gaea are defined by the allocation board, with
allocations allotted among different groups and systems. Each of these
currently has a portion of time allocated. Dual running is done within
the standard allocations under a QOS (Quality of Service) tag of "dual."
Windfall is a catch-all quality of service account for users who have
exhausted their groups monthly CPU allocation, or who wish to run
without charging to their groups CPU allocation and forfeit job priority
factors.
