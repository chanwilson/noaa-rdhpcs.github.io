Installing Miniconda
********************

Currently, Crusher and Frontier do **NOT** have Anaconda/Conda modules.
If your workflow better suits conda environments, you can install your own `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/main/miniconda.html>`__ on Frontier.

The install process is rather simple (with a few notable warnings, see :ref:`Cautionary Notes <miniconda-notes>` further below):

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir miniconda_frontier/
   cd miniconda_frontier/
   wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   chmod u+x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -u -p ~/miniconda_frontier

* The ``-p`` flag specifies the prefix path for where to install miniconda.
* The ``-u`` updates any current installations at the ``-p`` location (not necessary if you didn't do a "mkdir" beforehand)

Cautionary Notes
================

While running the installer, you will be prompted with something like this:

``Do you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3 by running conda init? [yes|no]``

If "yes", your ``.bashrc`` (or equivalent shell configuration file) will be updated with something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   # >>> conda initialize >>>
   # !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda initâ€™ !! .
   .
   .
   .
   .
   #unset __conda_setup
   # <<< conda initialize <<<

.. warning::
   By default, this will always initialize conda upon login, which clashes with other Python installations (e.g., if you use the anaconda modules on other OLCF systems).

It is **MUCH SAFER** to say "no" and to just export the ``PATH`` manually when on Frontier to avoid clashing:

.. code-block:: bash

   export PATH="/path/to/your/miniconda/bin:$PATH"

.. note::
   If your ``.bashrc`` already has a similar block of code (e.g., from other OLCF modules), then it will **NOT** modify your ``bashrc``

An additional recommendation is to set things to not activate your base environment by default (to help with the potential clashing):

.. code-block:: bash

   # Only needs to be run once after exporting conda into your PATH
   conda config --set auto_activate_base false

As always, if you encounter issue, don't hesitate to contact help@olcf.ornl.gov
